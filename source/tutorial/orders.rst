Tutorial: Orders
===================

Orders contain items and modifiers which the user wants prepared for them at their location on their ticket.  Ordering can be used for all kinds of fascinating things.  For instance, SubtleData demonstrated at the 2013 SXSW festival a mobile ordering app where you could order beers through a web application.  They would simply show up right at your table.

.. tip:: The code for the SXSW mobile ordering app is open source.  You can find it on `GitHub`_.
